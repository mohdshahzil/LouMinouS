# Multi-Tenant LMS Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
The Multi-Tenant LMS (Learning Management System) is a platform that allows organizations (tenants) to independently manage courses, lessons, users, and progress. Each tenant operates within an isolated environment while the platform owner oversees the entire system. The LMS is designed to be scalable, interactive, and engaging, leveraging gamification, adaptive learning, and AI-driven analytics.

## 2. Objectives

### 3.1 Tenant Features
- **Tenant Dashboard**: Centralized management of courses, users, and settings.
- **Course Management**: Tools to create, edit, and structure courses into modules and lessons.
- **User Roles**: Customizable roles such as Admin, Instructor, and Student.
- **Progress Tracking**: Insights into student progress and completion rates.
- **Custom Branding**: Options for tenants to personalize their subdomains with logos and themes.

### 3.2 Student Features
- **Course Access**: User-friendly interface to view and complete courses and lessons.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of lesson completion and achievements.
- **Interactive Content**: Engagement through rich text, quizzes, and polls.
